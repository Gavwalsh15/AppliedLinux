Project Description
GAVIN WALSH AND CILLIAN JENNINGS
On the webpage we have the time, date, CPU usage, memory usage, the weather for Galway, a button that turns the webpage pink, a button that will print out a random joke, a button will display a list of the processes running and the original button that sends a message to the server. The server usage, cpu usage and memory usage run using a bash script. The weather bash script prints out the location, temperature, if itâ€™s sunny or cloudy and if it rained recently. It uses the openweather.org api. The click to get joke button and get process button are zx scripts. The webpage uses hmtl, javascript and css.

To Run the program please run the setup.sh to start and run the server.
./setup.sh
